         * purpose bit flag is set (see below).  It is byte aligned
         * and immediately follows the last byte of compressed data.
         * This descriptor is used only when it was not possible to
         * seek in the output .ZIP file, e.g., when the output .ZIP file
         * was standard output or a non-seekable device.  For ZIP64(tm) format
         * archives, the compressed and uncompressed sizes are 8 bytes each.
         *
         * When compressing files, compressed and uncompressed sizes 
         * should be stored in ZIP64 format (as 8 byte values) when a 
         * files size exceeds 0xFFFFFFFF.   However ZIP64 format may be

         * 0x08074b50 has commonly been adopted as a signature value 
         * for the data descriptor record.  Implementers should be 
         * aware that ZIP files may be encountered with or without this 
         * signature marking data descriptors and should account for
         * either case when reading ZIP files to ensure compatibility.
         * When writing ZIP files, it is recommended to include the
         * signature value marking the data descriptor record.  When

         * purpose bit flag is set (see below).  It is byte aligned
         * and immediately follows the last byte of compressed data.
         * This descriptor is used only when it was not possible to
         * seek in the output .ZIP file, e.g., when the output .ZIP file
         * was standard output or a non-seekable device.  For ZIP64(tm) format
         * archives, the compressed and uncompressed sizes are 8 bytes each.
         *
         * When compressing files, compressed and uncompressed sizes 
         * should be stored in ZIP64 format (as 8 byte values) when a 
         * files size exceeds 0xFFFFFFFF.   However ZIP64 format may be

         * the zip64 extended information extra field is present for 
         * the file the compressed and uncompressed sizes will be 8

         * Although not originally assigned a signature, the value 
         * 0x08074b50 has commonly been adopted as a signature value 
         * for the data descriptor record.  Implementers should be 
         * aware that ZIP files may be encountered with or without this 
         * signature marking data descriptors and should account for
         * either case when reading ZIP files to ensure compatibility.
         * When writing ZIP files, it is recommended to include the
         * signature value marking the data descriptor record.  When
