Candidate Applicant Tracking System
Continuation of CATS

CATS development as open source has been stopped at 2008. OpenCATS continued the deveopment. But concentrated on OSATS. So we are continuing the project from OpenCATS 0.9.1.

Requirement:
Php 5.3 or later
mysql latest

Installation:
Please check doc/INSTALL for installation

The CanididATS 2.0.0 RC1 is not for production. 

The new features in CandidATS 2.0.0 RC1.

    1) Profile
    2) Roles
    3) Group
    
    Now the module’s list, preview, edit and create can be accessed based on these. Four modules are covered. 1) candidates 2) companies 3) contacts 4) joborders
    
    A role has to be assigned to a user
    A role can have many profiles
    
    The user access to the application’s module’s actions are based on the profiles assigned to role, to which the user belongs.
    
    The record can be assigned to either user or group. The group can hold users and roles
    
    The user can see his/her group records or the his/her records.
    
The CandidATS 2.0.0 RC1 Extra Field handling are not tested fully. So take care in using Extra Field
